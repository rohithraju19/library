            <strong>Author:</strong>Jerome.K.Jerome<br>
            <strong>Genre:</strong>Comedy Novel<br>
            <strong>Summary:</strong> Three Men in a Boat (To Say Nothing of the Dog),[Note 1] published in 1889,[1] is a humorous novel by English writer Jerome K. Jerome describing a two-week boating holiday on the Thames from Kingston upon Thames to Oxford and back to Kingston. The book was initially intended to be a serious travel guide,[2] with accounts of local history along the route, but the humorous elements took over to the point where the serious and somewhat sentimental passages seem a distraction to the comic novel. One of the most praised things about Three Men in a Boat is how undated it appears to modern readers â€“ the jokes have been praised as fresh and witty.[3]

            The three men are based on Jerome himself (the narrator Jerome K. Jerome) and two real-life friends, George Wingrave (who would become a senior manager at Barclays Bank) and Carl Hentschel<br>
